# codeforcesInfoGrabber
This app scrapes user info such as profile, contest history, submission history from the users codeforces account and provides a nice JSON object


This app asks for the user's username in the site whose information they want.
Information from three different competitive coding sites are available:
(1) codeforces
(2) spoj
(3) codechef

The app has been deployed at heroku at the link: https://floating-sierra-38684.herokuapp.com/spoj/?handle=deb_brav0s .
You can use this link by changing the 'codeforces' to 'spoj' or 'codechef' and by giving your own handle in place of 'deb_brav0s'(which is my handle by the way)
